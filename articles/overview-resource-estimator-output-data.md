## Space diagram

The overall physical resource estimation consists of total number of physical qubits used for both the algorithm and T factory copies. You can inspect the distribution between these two using the space diagram.

The space diagram shows the proportion of the physical qubits used for the algorithm and the [T factories](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.tfactories). Note that the number of T factory copies contributes to the number of physical qubits for T factories.

In Jupyter Notebook, you can access the space diagram using the `SpaceChart` widget from the `qsharp-widgets` package.

```python
import qsharp

from qsharp_widgets import SpaceChart
SpaceChart(result)
```

There's a table with the breakdown of number of T factory copies and number of physical qubits per T factory.":::

When running multiple configurations of target parameters with the [Pareto frontier estimation](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#pareto-frontier-estimation), you can plot the space diagram for a specific solution of the. For example, the following code shows how to plot the space diagram for the first configuration of parameters and the third shortest runtime.

```python
SpaceChart(result[0], 2) # First (estimate index=0) run and third (point index=2) shortest runtime
```

## Space-time diagram

In quantum computing, there's a tradeoff between the number of physical qubits and the runtime of the algorithm. You could consider allocation of as many physical qubits as possible to reduce the runtime of the algorithm. However, the number of physical qubits is limited by the number of physical qubits available in the quantum hardware. Understanding the tradeoff between runtime and system scale is one of the more important aspects of resource estimation. 

When estimating the resources of an algorithm, you can use the space-time diagram to visualize the tradeoffs between the number of physical qubits and the runtime of the algorithm.

> [!NOTE]
> To see multiple optimal combinations in the space-time diagram, you need to set the estimation type to [Pareto frontier estimation](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator#pareto-frontier-estimation). If you run the Resource Estimator in Visual Studio Code using the **Q#: Calculate Resource Estimates** option, the Pareto frontier estimation is enabled by default.

The space-time diagram allows you to find the optimal combination of {number of qubits, runtime} pairs that satisfy the constraints of the quantum hardware. The diagram shows the number of physical qubits and the runtime of the algorithm for each {number of qubits, runtime} pair.

To run the space-time diagram in Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `EstimatesOverview` widget from the `qsharp-widgets` package.

```python
import qsharp

from qsharp_widgets import EstimatesOverview

EstimatesOverview(result, colors=["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e"], runNames=["e4 Surface Code", "e6 Floquet Code"])
```

> [!TIP]
> To see the estimation details, you can hover over each point in the diagram.

The space-time diagram is specially useful when comparing multiple configurations of target parameters for the same algorithm.
