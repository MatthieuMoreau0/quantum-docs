# Introduction to Q#

Q# is a high-level, open-source programming language for developing and running quantum algorithms. As part of the Quantum Development Kit (QDK), it's designed to work with any quantum hardware, scale to all quantum applications, and optimize execution. For more information about the QDK, see ...

As a programming language, Q# borrows elements from Python, C#, and F#, and supports a basic procedural model for writing programs with loops, if/then statements, and common data types. It also introduces quantum-specific data structures and operations, such as repeat-until-success, that allow you to integrate quantum and classical computations. For example, the flow control of a classical program can be based on the outcome of a quantum measurement.
